# Uniform Distribution ðŸ‘•ðŸ“±

**Uniform Distribution** is a minimal React Native app that helps users wear all their clothes evenly.  
The app tracks daily outfit photos and suggests which clothes to wear next based on usage frequency.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Take a daily picture of yourself wearing your outfit.  
The app keeps track of when each item (shirt, pants, etc.) was last worn.  
Next time, it suggests the items you rarely wear so your wardrobe usage stays uniformly distributed.
